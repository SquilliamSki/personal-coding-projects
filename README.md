# personal-coding-projects
Collection of my personal coding projects

Figured I should start learning Git for personal and work related skills.
I'll try my best to use and update this with new projects as I make them.

Explanation of the projects:
-hptodp.py
    A funn little executable that runs a simple converter from horsepower to duckpower. It is estimated that ~131 ducks is equal to 1 horsepower. Thought it would be a fun idea to hav this and also a greta learning oppurtunity to start working with the tkinter library.

-random_menu.py
    A collection of small coding projects put into one menu for easy access. Ranging from a password generator to a Smite random god picker. Needs some tuning still but works relativly well for now.
